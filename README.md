## Hosted on Pantheon

- This is a WordPress repository configured to run on the [Pantheon
  platform](https://pantheon.io).
- [Collaborative Development Using GitHub and Pantheon | Pantheon Docs][collab]
- Pantheon still uses `master` as the default branch. This will eventually be
  fixed ([Inclusive Language at Pantheon and in the Pantheon Community |
  Pantheon Docs][inclusive]).
